The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class can be unreliable in certain browser versions and may require a fallback. A common strategy is to add a JavaScript check to determine if the focus is programmatically set, such as by checking if the `focus` event's target was triggered by a user interaction. 

Here is a potential solution for JavaScript interaction: 

```javascript
  document.addEventListener('focusin', (event) => {
    if (!event.isTrusted) { 
      // Programmatically set focus, add a class to handle styling
      event.target.classList.add('programmatically-focused');
    }
  });
```

Then, add styling in your CSS:

```css
  /*Existing styles*/
  button:focus-visible {
    outline: 2px solid blue;
  }
  button.programmatically-focused {
    outline: none; /*Avoids visual focus when programmatically focused*/
  }
```

This approach gives you more control, allowing specific styles for user-initiated and programmatic focus scenarios.
